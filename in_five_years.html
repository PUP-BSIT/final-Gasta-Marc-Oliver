      <h1>My Vision: 5 Years from Now</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p id="future-text">
          In five years from now, I honestly don't know what to say, or what I'm
          doing I don't have any idea. For sure, yes, I do have hopes for that
          up comming five years. I want my life to be a little better. A litte
          more happier that what I am right now. A little more content, more
          mature, more money, of course. More life, and more time and more love.
          I want to envision myself to be better than what I am right now. More
          considerate, probably smarter than me. Wiser in all things. I want my
          future self to have a better skills than what I have right now. More
          powerful, much smarter in coding skills. Right now I am blank. Blank
          of what I'm doing for the next five years, but I said I have hopes.
          Hopes to achieve my goals and fulfill my plans. Hopes to be a better
          person. Maybe I don't have a clear ambition for myself in the next
          years but I think I have a message for my future self.

          <span> Dear Macky,</span>
          I hope you're okay. I know it might be hard now, because of what we've
          been through but I hope you see me as part of your journey. I'm the
          past and you're the future. Right now I don't have any idea how well
          you are. If you are happy or sad or what. But please remember to look
          back and see me and little us inside. I'm proud of you. You've come a
          long way. Fought a lot of battle that you never thought you'd win but
          here you are looking good and all. I know that you are doing the best
          to achieve everything. I know we are not that smart we are not that
          strong but we are a fighter. We lose, yes but we don't give up. If
          live gives us bumps we just go through it and laugh at it. Please
          don't lose yourself in the road. Just keep on smiling and always use
          humour. I hope you are in a better shape. Better place, better state
          of mind. I hope you area in a good starting job and I hope that you
          like it or love it. I hope that you still can pet our dog Ali.
